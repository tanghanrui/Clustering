## This is a study journal for unsupervised learning: Clustering

The goal of cluster analysis, or segmentation, is to group observations so that observations within the same grouping, 
or clusterm, are more closely related than observations in different clusters. An essential component of clustering 
techniques is a measure of distance/similarities between observations. It uses Euclidean distance and pythagorean theorem 
to do the calculation 

I will explore college scorecard dataset with two kind of clustering techniques
1. K-means clustering
2. Hierarchical clustering

## About the data
The US News and World Report’s college ranking system was launched in 1983 with the purpose of comparing and scoring colleges
based on metrics like acceptance rate and student SAT scores. Since that time, the limitations of this ranking system have
become apparent to many. President Obama argued that the rankings do not actually reflect stu- dent preferences, and more 
importantly labor market outcomes after graduation. He also noted that such scoring systems encourage col- leges and 
universities to game their metrics. Sometimes the gaming comes in the form of making costly investments in facilities that 
sub- stantially increase the costs of college, while having little to no effect on the quality of the education they provide.
Sometimes the gaming is all out cheating, includ- ing lying about SAT scores, and fudging acceptance, retention and graduation 
rates.

According to President Obama, “Everyone should be able to find clear, reliable, open data on college affordability and 
value—like whether they’re likely to graduate, find good jobs, and pay off their loans.” Beyond prospective students, 
colleges and universities often don’t have essential data to investigate how well they are preparing their students for 
success in the job market. The College Scorecard dataset was released by the Obama administration to address both of these 
concerns.
